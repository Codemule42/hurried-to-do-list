# Speed Test - Todo List
You have 60 minutes to create a simple web application - a todo list.

You have a Macbook Pro. You are allowed to download, install, or look up anything you need to get the job done. Atom, iTerm, `brew`, `npm`, and `git` are already installed.

Feel free to use anything (libraries, frameworks, tools, documentation, application skeletons, etc) that makes the job easier. The end result must be your own creation, though - you can’t just fork someone else’s completed todo list application or follow a step-by-step tutorial somewhere.

There are some basic requirements, but you’re free to implement anything else on top of that for bonus points, so long as you can get it done within the allotted time. The application and code must be in a clean and stable state at the end.

### Basic requirements
- Add task
- Remove task
- Toggle task completion state

### Bonus points
- Give it a nice look and feel
- Push to a Github account
- Persist state across refreshes
- Task reordering
- Multi-user support
- Anything else you can think of
